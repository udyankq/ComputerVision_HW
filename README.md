Computer Vision assignments (HW3–HW14) using OpenCV and MediaPipe

HW3	FaceMesh
HW4	Harris Corner Detection
HW5	ORB Feature Detection
HW6	Motion Detection
HW7	ArUco Markers
HW8	Object Tracking
HW9	Mouth Blur
HW10	Thresholding (Binary / Adaptive)
HW11	Image Stitching
HW12	Hand Tracking
HW13	Contours Detection
HW14	Push-up Counter (Pose Estimation)

technologies used:
Python
OpenCV
MediaPipe
NumPy

How to run
1. Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run any homework
python HW14_PushupCounter/main.py

Large video files are excluded via .gitignore
Some assignments require webcam

Some assignments (HW6 – Motion Detection and HW14 – Push-up Counter) require video demonstrations.
The original video files are too large to be uploaded to GitHub due to file size limitations and repository performance considerations.
Therefore, the demo videos have been uploaded to Google Drive instead.
The corresponding Google Drive links are provided in a separate file inside the HW6 and HW14 folders.
